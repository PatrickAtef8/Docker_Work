# Docker Playground

Hey 👋  
This is my personal Docker playground — a place where I experiment, learn, and occasionally mess things up while figuring out Docker step by step. Think of it as *my little study corner for containers*.  

## What’s in here so far

### `01-understanding-docker/`  
A step-by-step guide I’ve been putting together for myself, split into small chapters. Each folder focuses on a specific Docker concept, so it’s easier to follow.  

## Notes

- Try the examples yourself — it’s the best way to learn  
- Don’t worry about breaking things — containers are made to be disposable  
- Check each `README.md` for more explanations
